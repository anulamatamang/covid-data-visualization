# covid-data-visualization
Individual country visualization and a world-map visualization of covid data.

### Important note
The api used to fetch covid data for individual graph visualization has stopped updating the daily and total recovered cases. Due to this, the line visual of total recovered cases
in homepage sharply drops to zero since the day the update for recovered cases stopped.
